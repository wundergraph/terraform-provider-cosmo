# cosmo_feature_subgraph (Resource)

this resource handles feature subgraphs. Feature subgraphs are a special type of subgraph that can be used to extend the functionality of the platform.
They require a base subgraph to be specified and can be used to add additional functionality to the base subgraph based on a specialized schema, that is published
to this subgraph.

For more information on feature subgraphs, please refer to the [Cosmo Documentation](https://cosmo-docs.wundergraph.com/cli/feature-subgraph).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cosmo_feature_subgraph" "example" {
  name                  = var.name
  namespace             = var.namespace
  routing_url           = var.routing_url
  subscription_url      = var.subscription_url
  subscription_protocol = var.subscription_protocol
  websocket_subprotocol = var.websocket_subprotocol
  base_subgraph_name    = var.base_subgraph_name
  schema                = var.schema
  readme                = var.readme
}
```
